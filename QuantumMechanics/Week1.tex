    \subsubsection*{Born Statistical Interpretation of Wave Function}
    The wave function $\Psi (x,t)$ discribes the "Amplitude" of the probability finding the paticle at coordinate(x,t). While the probability density equals amplitude squared.

    That is, the probability finding the particle among $x\in [a,b]$ at time $t_0$ is discribed as:
    \begin{equation*}
        P(x\in [a,b],t=t_0)=\int^{b}_{a}|\psi|^{2}dx=\int^{b}_{a}\psi^*\psi dx
    \end{equation*}

    Or, to say, the \textit{Probability Density} can be written as:
    \begin{equation*}
        p(x,t)=|\psi(x,t)|^2=\psi^{*}(x,t)\psi(x,t)
    \end{equation*}

                \left\{\begin{array}{ll}
